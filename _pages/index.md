# about

I'm a first-year PhD researcher at the <a href="https://www.eui.eu/en/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener">European University Institute (EUI)</a>, supervised by <a href="http://www.kevinmunger.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kevin Munger</a> and <a href="https://arnoutvanderijt.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Arnout van de Rijt</a>. I am interested in the dynamics of opinion formation and in the conditions that enable meaningful deliberation in online spaces. Currently, I focus on political and behavioral contexts in which the voices of a small minority of internet users are amplified, reaching a much broader audience and potentially shaping public opinion. You can also read more by looking at my [current research projects](/research/).

Before joining EUI, I had the opportunity to study at multiple universities and engage with diverse research fields. I started my journey at ETH Zurich, where I obtained a BSc in mechanical engineering and a MSc in robotics, systems and control. During that time, I focused on the modeling and control of nonlinear systems, with an emphasis on numerical simulations and optimization (<a href="https://idsc.ethz.ch/research-zeilinger.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Insitute for Dynamic Systems and Control</a>, <a href="https://srl.ethz.ch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Soft Robotics Lab</a>, <a href="https://www.georgehaller.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chair in Nonlinear Dynamics</a>). Have a look at my previous [publications](/publications/) if you want more details!

While on exchange at Imperial College in 2022, I decided to apply to the MA in political science at the University of Zurich out of curiosity. This decision was an important personal milestone, as I gradually shifted my focus, time and energy towards the social sciences. My Master's thesis about toxic speech on TikTok gave me the opportunity to visit <a href="https://csmapnyu.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NYU's Center for Social Media and Politics</a> for a few months in spring 2025 and to work with the research group on <a href="https://www.ipz.uzh.ch/en/research/professorships-and-research-areas/bdm.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Political Behavior and Digital Media</a> at the Univerity of Zurich.  

Alongside my studies, I am active in [different organisations and projects](/other-projects/). In particular, I'm board member of <a href="https://girlscodetoo.ch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GirlsCodeToo</a>, a Swiss non-profit with the mission of encouraging young girls to discover coding and explore careers in tech, aiming at closing the gender gap in these fields.
